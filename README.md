# Coding Quiz

## Description

Test your knowledge of Javascript fundementals with this short and deceptively easy timed quiz! Watch out, incorrect answers will deduct points from your time (and your score).

## Resources

This application utilizes HTML, CSS, and is dynamically powered by Javascript. Background image is courtesy of unsplash.com, photo credit to Ferenc Almasi. Fonts supplied by Google Fonts. A special thanks to my TAs for providing documentation assisting with array methods. Last but not least, thank you to those posting questions and answers on StackOverflow, a great resource for both finding new documentation, but also for seeing new ways to think through problems.

## For Development

In the future, I would like to enhance this quiz with more creative questions, some sound effects, and animation. These enhancements would add more interaction and possibly more user-engagement.
